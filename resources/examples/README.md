# Examples

The examples in the sdtm folder were created from XPT files that were published as part of the [SDTM Metadata Submission Guidelines v2.0](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtm/sdtm-metadata-submission-guidelines-v2-0).
The examples in the adam folder were created from XPT files that were part of the [CDISC SDTM / ADaM Pilot Project](https://github.com/cdisc-org/sdtm-adam-pilot-project).

The i18n folder contains a JSON file with the AETERM variable in Japanese.

For illustration purposes several variables that had a DataType='float' in Define-XML had their data type converted to 'decimal' in the JSON examples.

The JSON files support the following data types:

- string
- integer
- float
- double
- decimal
- boolean

The example JSON files, XPT files, and Define-XML documents are for illustration purposes only and may not conform to regulatory health authorities' requirements/guidance.
