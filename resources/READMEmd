# Dataset-JSON Hackathon Home

Open-Source Tools using Dataset-JSON
Our primary objective for the Hackathon is to develop open-source tools that make it easier to start using Dataset-JSON. We hope to see tools that convert Dataset-JSON to other common formats as well as convert other formats to Dataset-JSON, such as:
SAS v5 XPORT & SAS datasets
R dataframes
Python Pandas dataframes

Additional Open-Source Tools
CDISC is also interested in seeing what other tools may be developed as there is no restriction on what tools you work on. Examples of other tools could include:
Dataset-JSON browser or viewer
Dataset-JSON tools that work in combination with Define-XML
A RESTful API for Dataset-JSON
Creating new projects or extending existing projects to use Dataset-JSON are both acceptable options.
